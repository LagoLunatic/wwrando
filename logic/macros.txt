Can Get Past Forsaken Fortress Gate:

  # Note: The Ice Ring and Savage ones have Bokoblins in the same room as the Darknut, so in swordless you could trick the Darknut into attack a Bokoblin, steal its Machete, and use it to kill the Darknut. But this would be too tedious to do to farm a lot of Knight's Crests, so it's not in the logic.

Can Defeat Moblins:
  Hero's Sword
  | Hero's Bow
  | Bombs
  | Skull Hammer
  # Moblins are tricky to kill with just Bombs because they run away from them when they reach low health. Easiest way is to use one bomb to knock the spear out of its hands, then use the spear to kill it.
Can Defeat Darknuts:
  Hero's Sword
  | Light Arrows
  # Skull Hammer also works, but is tricky to do without taking lots of damage, so it's not in the logic.
  # The most consistent way with Skull Hammer is to run up to a Darknut, do a spin attack to hit its armor, roll away to dodge its attack, roll back in and do another spin attack, and repeat until the armor has been broken.

  # Note: Skull Hammer can stun them without taking damage if you hit the ground near them instead of hitting them directly.
  # Note: Grappling Hook does stun it just barely long enough for you to kill it with your sword.
  # But this is not immediately obvious and somewhat tricky to time, so maybe reserve that for a higher difficulty level.
Can Defeat Dark ChuChus:

  # Luring a ChuChu up the hill and having it jump on the trees doesn't work.
  # Carrying the big pig to the trees and enraging it DOES work, it can cut the trees. But this is not currently in the logic because it's obscure and slow to do.
