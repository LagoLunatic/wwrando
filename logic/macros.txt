Can Farm Green Chu Jelly:
  Grappling Hook & Spoils Bag
  # Green ChuChus are accessible without any items on Outset at night.
Can Obtain 15 Blue Chu Jelly:
  # There are 23 Blue ChuChus in the game, which each drop their jelly only once.
  # 14/23 need no items to reach (not counting the items needed to defeat/steal from them).
  # The remaining 9/23 do need items to reach.
  # So all you need to get 15 is any 1 out of the 9 requirements.

  Hero's Sword
  | Hero's Bow
  | Bombs
  | Skull Hammer
  # Moblins are tricky to kill with just Bombs because they run away from them when they reach low health. Easiest way is to use one bomb to knock the spear out of its hands, then use the spear to kill it.
Can Defeat Darknuts:
  Hero's Sword
  | Light Arrows
  | Skull Hammer
  # Removing their armor with Skull Hammer is tricky.
  # The most consistent way with Skull Hammer is to run up to a Darknut, do a spin attack to hit its armor, roll away to dodge its attack, roll back in and do another spin attack, and repeat until the armor has been broken.
  # Another way is to circle around the Darknut counterclockwise without locking onto it and wait for it to attack. As soon as it attacks, use the hammer to attack its back and its armor will fall off in one hit.
Can Defeat Darknuts Easily:
  Hero's Sword
  | Light Arrows
Can Defeat Mighty Darknuts:
  Can Defeat Darknuts Easily
  | (Skull Hammer & Precise 3)
  # The capes Mighty Darknuts have mean the one hit armor removal with the hammer doesn't work.
  # Precise: Destroying the armor the slow way by hitting it repeatedly with spinning hammer attacks is *extremely* difficult against Mighty Darknuts, but it is possible, even with only 3 hearts.

Can Defeat Poes Without Light Ray:
  Hero's Sword
  | Hero's Bow
  | Boomerang
  | Hookshot
  | Skull Hammer
  | Grappling Hook
  # You can knock the lantern out of its hands, then let it possess you and eventually it will disappear.
  # Or you can just shoot it with Light Arrows which is easier - but that doesn't need to be in logic since if you have the bow you can knock the lantern out of its hands instead.
  # Note: Knocking the lantern out of its hands is also possible with bombs, but this is not required by the logic as the hitbox is surprisingly precise and you would need the Poe to stay almost right on top of the bomb until it explodes, which is not feasible in all locations a Poe may appear in enemy rando.
Can Defeat Jalhalla Poes:
  Hero's Sword
  | Hero's Bow
  | Bombs
  | Skull Hammer
  # Note: Grappling Hook stuns Poes, but doesn't damage them.
Can Defeat Stalfos:
  Hero's Sword
  | Bombs
  | Skull Hammer
  | Light Arrows
  # Some other items can damage the head once you break the body apart, but you still need sword/bombs/hammer/light arrows to break it apart in the first place.
Can Defeat Floormasters:
  Hero's Sword
  | Hero's Bow
  | (Skull Hammer & Precise 1)
  # Precise: When using Skull Hammer to kill Floormasters, there's a chance you'll miss because of their wonky hitbox, and get taken all the way back to the dungeon entrance.
  # Bombs also work, but it's very annoying to hit them since they throw the bombs back at you. They also go back in the ground becoming invulnerable if you get too far away.
  # Hero's Bow would only be an issue if you run out of arrows when you need to kill a ton of Floormasters - aka the Earth Temple foggy Floormaster room. But thankfully that room has tons of skulls that drop arrow refills.
Can Defeat Morths:

  # They never die forever, they come back the instant they're cut down.
  # Things that trigger when all enemies are dead will never trigger.
Can Defeat Freshwater Octoroks:
  Hero's Bow
  | Boomerang
  | Hookshot
  # The sword and shield can be used to reflect projectiles back at them to kill them, but this only works if the player is at the same horizontal level as the Octorok, otherwise it won't shoot projectiles in the first place.
  # Bombs can also kill them, but they only work in situations where you can actually throw a bomb far enough to reach them. Even then, the timing is very precise because the bomb will be defused when it hits the water.
Can Defeat Saltwater Octoroks:
  Hero's Bow
  | Boomerang
  | Hookshot
  # Bombs work when fired from KoRL's cannon, but if a Saltwater Octorok got placed somewhere not in the sea you couldn't use the cannon, and it's too hard to hit them by throwing bombs.
Can Defeat Beamos:
  Nothing
  # Beamos do not count as alive, and therefore not being able to kill them doesn't stop a room from thinking all enemies in the room are dead.

  # Bombs are tricky since you have to repeatedly use hookshot to keep the tongue in place while you wait for the bomb, or you have to aim the hookshot at the bomb to set it off instantly.

Can Destroy Cannons:
  Bombs
  | Boomerang
  # Two hits from the boomerang also destroys cannons.
Can Cut Down Outset Trees:
  Hero's Sword
  | Boomerang
  | Skull Hammer
  | (Power Bracelets & Obscure 3)
  # Fire Arrows and Bombs don't work.
  # Luring a ChuChu up the hill and having it jump on the trees doesn't work.
  # Obscure: You can carry the big pig to the trees and enrage it, then trick it into cutting down the trees, although this is slow.
  # You can do the pig method without any other items besides Power Bracelets, and without taking any damage from the enraged pig.
  # To do this, first carry the pig to the trees. Then pick it up and throw it against the wall several times. For the tenth throw, instead of throwing it against the wall, throw it *through* the trees.
  # Being thrown ten times will enrage it, so it will start rushing at you, cutting the trees down in the process. As soon as it comes back through the trees, pick it up again to calm it down so it doesn't hurt you.
Can Cut Down Hanging DRC Platform:
  Hero's Sword
  | Bombs
  | Hero's Bow
  | Skull Hammer
  | (Hookshot & Precise 1)
  | (Grappling Hook & Precise 1)
