  # Moblins are tricky to kill with just Bombs because they run away from them when they reach low health. Easiest way is to use one bomb to knock the spear out of its hands, then use the spear to kill it.
Can Defeat Darknuts:
  Hero's Sword
  | Light Arrows
  # Skull Hammer also works, but is tricky to do without taking lots of damage, so it's not in the logic.
  # The most consistent way with Skull Hammer is to run up to a Darknut, do a spin attack to hit its armor, roll away to dodge its attack, roll back in and do another spin attack, and repeat until the armor has been broken.
  # Another way is to circle around the Darknut counterclockwise without locking onto it and wait for it to attack. As soon as it attacks, use the hammer to attack its back and its armor will fall off in one hit.
